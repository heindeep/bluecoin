<h2>BlueCoin</h2>
<p> BlueCoin is released with the mission of providing a convenient way for our customers while investing
	into all projects in the Bluecoin Eco System. BlueCoin is essentially a hybrid cryptocurrency system 
	based on PIVX that forked from DASH that forked from Bitcoin. In addition to the traditional Proof-of-Work
	(PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) concepts, BlueCoin also employs the most beneficial crypto-earning method
	- Masternode. Powered by Neoscrypt - a well-known ASIC resistant crypto algorithm - during PoW phase, you 
	can all have chance to earn Bluecoins by using consumer grade hardware's like CPU and GPUs. During PoS 
	phase, the most latest PoS protocol, PoS v3.0 is used.
